# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- ================================== -->

Here are some hints to get you started:

<!-- - The Journal App has a header, a main section and a footer. -->
<!-- - In the main section, there is an entry form and an entries section. -->

- The entry form has an input, a textarea and a submit button.
- The entries section has a tab bar (or tabs) and an entry list.
- The tab bar has two tabs, each with a badge with the number of entries.
- Each entry in the entry list has a title, a date, a text and a favorite icon button.
